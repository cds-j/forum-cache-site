          reserve® is a publication seeking to share insight on contemporary jazz as art
          (within all disciplines). Every issue prioritizes space for fundamental political
          text concerning socialism/communism, decolonization, organizing, the black
          radical tradition, and afrofuturism. Although recently conceived, this will be
          a public undertaking and we want jazz lovers, artists, historians, enthusiasts, writers,
          educators, students, and everyone adjacent to contribute to this effort for social/cultural 
          documentation and political education.

          <i>We are actively building an online space, and are inquiring about an in-person space
          in <b>Houston, Texas</b> for contributors to add onto the first issue (maybe something like <a
          href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> or a residency program?) At the moment, 
          if you would like to help with something like this, please feel free to email cdsherrardjr@gmail.com or
