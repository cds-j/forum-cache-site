# forum cache®

**_forum cache_** is an _ongoing experiment_ seeking to utilize specialized, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary art practices to document the times, express ourselves in the present, design the future, and engineer the answers to world crises.

Learning in public is an integral part of communal problem solving. Even though my experience with teams seeking to confront these objectives are minimal at best, I believe many engineers and creatives are seeking to contribute just as much as I am. **_forum cache_** as an entity isn't the priority, it's just a title for the vehicle. So, for now, I'll share how the site is built and its expected direction as a functioning go-to for **fill in the blank*.

## reserve®
As an ongoing experiment, the next step is always up for redetermination. 

Today, **reserve®**, a jazz/art/political publication, is in production to be an online/printed source for contemporary jazz examined as art and/or a vehicle for propaganda. 

For the foreseeable future, **_forum cache_** will engage in printing and publishing black literature and art books and pressing limited runs of select records for musicians/artists on an international scale.
